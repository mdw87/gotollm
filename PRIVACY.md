# Privacy Policy — GoToLLM

**Last updated: February 22, 2026**

## Summary

GoToLLM does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

## What the Extension Does

GoToLLM reads the text you type into Chrome's address bar and constructs a URL to redirect you to an AI chatbot (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, or Grok) with your prompt pre-filled. This all happens locally in your browser.

## Data Collection

- **No data is collected.** Your prompts are never sent to any server operated by this extension.
- **No analytics or tracking.** There are no analytics tools, trackers, or telemetry of any kind.
- **No network requests.** The only network activity is the browser navigation to the AI chatbot's website — the same as if you had typed the URL yourself.

## Local Storage

The extension stores one piece of information locally on your device using Chrome's `storage.sync` API: your chosen default LLM (e.g. "chatgpt"). This preference is stored in your own browser and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

When you use GoToLLM to navigate to an AI chatbot, you are subject to that service's own privacy policy. GoToLLM has no affiliation with and no control over ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, or Grok.

## Open Source
